A friend of mine shared this video uploaded by RSA on the difference between sympathy and empathy. This video is short (3 minutes) and definitely thought provoking.

During difficult times, a friend might come to you and share their thoughts so that they can feel better. We often tend to sympathize with them and do one of the following - 

1. Offer Advice Based on Your Past Experience - There are a couple of reasons why I think this won't work - they're not in the frame of mind to listen to you right now and also they don't believe you completely understand their situation (reminds me of this [post](http://alearningaday.com/2015/03/no-you-dont-really-know.html) by Rohan).

2. Silverline their situation - While we tend to use this to cheer them up so that they can feel better but this seldom works - again you're not dealing with their situation.

Instead, we could **take their perspective, recognize it as the truth and stay out of judgement** (sounds simple, isn't it?). Rarely can a response make the other person feel better but what can actually make them feel better is the connection, the friendship and **communicating** that you're there with them during this difficult time.
