My friend had come home and I was telling him that I need to get some work done over the weekend but I was feeling a tad lazy. He asked me to start by cleaning the house. I was skeptical first - there seemed to be no correlation between a clean house and me working on my laptop.

I decided to give it a try anyways, worst case I thought I'd end up with no work done but a clean home. I did the livingroom, cleared my study table and setup my laptop on the table before I went to sleep (nothing fancy - took me 1 hour max).

I got up the next day and I had a really productive day. I'm not sure if there's any research/study on the correlation between the two but it sure does seem to work!!

P.S. *Found this useful tip on keeping a clean home -*
