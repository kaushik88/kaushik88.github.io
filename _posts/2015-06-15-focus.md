One of things that Jony Ive learnt from Steve Jobs was how to **focus**. Steve had a great definition for it.

Steve had asked Jony to list the things that he had said *No* to. Jony gave it some thought and listed a few things that he had said *No* to. However, Steve knew that Jony wasn't interested in doing those things anyway. Steve then gives this definition of focus - 

> What focus means is saying NO to something that with every bone in your body, you think is a phenomenal
idea and you wake up thinking about it, but you say NO to it because you're focusing on something else.
