A few months ago, my [friend](http://kdheepak.com/) migrated his blog to github pages. At that time, I had just started to blog on [medium](http://medium.com/) and I didn't know if I had the discipline to continue it for a long time. After 10 blog posts in 10 weeks (not saying that this is a lot but definitely better than 0), I'm finally convinced to have my own blogging website.

So, I called up my friend and he told me that getting started with Github pages and Jekyll (or Pelican that he was using) should take a **couple of hours** max (Thanks KD). So, after many hours of coding, tinkering with many designs and writing a blog post on [Hofstadter's law](http://kaushik88.github.io/blog/2015/05/15/hofstadter%27s-law/), I've finally got it up and running!

Some of the benefits of migrating to github pages from medium - 

1. Detailed logging using MixPanel or Google Analytics.
2. Embedding videos in the page.
3. Easy to share code (duh - it is hosted on github).
4. More control of the look and feel of the site.
5. Version control.
6. The joy of pushing code everytime you publish a post :)


Probably there are many more too, but I'm just getting started! I'm hoping this would be worth the initial effort. Feel free to explore this site and let me know your thoughts on the design and structure.
