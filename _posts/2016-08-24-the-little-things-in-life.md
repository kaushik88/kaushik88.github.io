I was spending time with my 2 year-old niece and after her afternoon nap, she got up and gave me a good smile. I looked at her and immediately I knew this is what **pure happiness** must look like. I asked my sister why is she so happy and she replied - *"She just had a good afternoon nap and she's happy!"*

As I spent more time with her, I saw her being happy and celebrating her daily activities - a long bath, a good meal, an evening stroll in the park, watching rhymes on TV, mom's hug and spending time with her dad. As adults, we don't really appreciate the smaller things in life and we often look for big moments and reasons to celebrate.

It's amazing how much we can learn from kids!
