A few things I've learnt on spending money - 

1. **Experience vs Things** - If I had to choose between buying a luxury car vs a moderate car **and** a trip to Hawaii, I'd always pick the latter. Why? Because, we tend to get used to luxurious things. However, we cherish our experiences.

2. **Learning** - There are numerous benefits to learning - keeps your mind nimble, keeps you humble, grounded and you're constantly improving. Whether you're spending money on a new skill to advance your career or a hobby, it's never a bad idea.

3. **Spend money where you spend time** - If you're going to spend 8 hours a day sleeping, it makes sense to put money on a comfortable mattress. If you're going to spend most of your weekends at home, it makes sense to live in a nice comfortable house.
