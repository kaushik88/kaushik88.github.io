The [book](http://www.amazon.com/Why-CEOs-Fail-Behaviors-Derail/dp/0787967637/) talks about 11 personality traits that could derail an executive/CEO's career. They're - 

1. *Arrogance* - You're right and everybody else is wrong.
2. *Melodrama* - You always grab the center of attention.
3. *Volatility* - Your mood swings drive business swings.
4. *Excessive Caution* - The next decision you make may be your first.
5. *Habitual Distrust* - You focus on the negatives.
6. *Aloofness* - You disengage and disconnext.
7. *Mischievousnesss* - Rules are made to be broken
8. *Eccentricity* - It's fun to be different just for the sake of it.
9. *Passive Resistance* - Your silence is misinterpreted as agreement.
10. *Perfectionism* - Get the little things right even if the big things go wrong.
11. *Eagerness to Please* - Winning the popularity contest matters most.

**Learnings From the Book**

1. **Stress** - Most of these derailers are a result of stress to a positive personality trait. For example, if *self confidence* is one of your strengths it might turn into *arrogance* under stress or being *charismatic* might become *melodramatic* under stress. And if you think about it, self-confidence and charisma might be the reason for your climb to the top of the ladder.

2. **Crossing The Line** - The goal of this book isn't to eradicate these traits but to be aware of them and act on them when under stress. The other thing that I liked about this book is that for each of the derailer, there is a section which indicates when you've crossed the line - from self-confidence to arrogance or from charisma to melodrama and so on.

3. The book is applicable to everyone - just think of yourself as the CEO of your life :)
