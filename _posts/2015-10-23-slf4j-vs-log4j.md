Any Java developer who has worked on production systems or applications would realize the importance of logging. And in Java, there are various logging tools - java.util.logging, log4j and slf4j. I've been using log4j for a while now but recently switched to slf4j and here's why - 

1. slf4j is not an implementation but it is an abstraction layer. So, if you're writing a library that would be passed around, you don't want your library to be tied to a particular logging implementation - slf4j provides this abstraction.

2. The other main reason for switching is the use of placeholders in slf4j. This is a commonly found code snippet if you're using log4j, 

{% highlight java %}
logger.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + String.valueOf(entry[i]));
{% endhighlight %}

In the above statement, both **i** and **entry[i]** are converted to Strings and then concatenated, irrespective of whether this statement is logged or not. This cost could be overcome by the use of an if statement - 

{% highlight java %}
if(logger.isDebugEnabled()) {
  logger.debug("Entry number: " + i + " is " + String.valueOf(entry[i]));
}
{% endhighlight %}

The above code snippet will ensure that the string concatenation is not executed when the logging level is set to - say ERROR. However, there is always a conditional check (to check the logging level). Additionally, having a lot of these code snippets impacts the code readability. The problem is solved in slf4j by using placeholders - 

{% highlight java %}
logger.debug("Entry number {} is {}",i, entry[i]);
{% endhighlight %}

In the above statement, the string concatenation happens only when the logging level is set to DEBUG and also there are no conditional checks.
