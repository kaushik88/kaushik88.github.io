Below are some of the commands that I commonly use in Git and I find them to be useful - 

**Adding Committed Files to Gitignore**

	1. Add /path/to/file to .gitignore
	2. git rm --cached /path/to/file

**Removing Local Commits**

One way to do this is to delete the local branch altogether and pull from origin again.
	
	1. git branch -D <local-branch>
	2. git checkout origin/<branch> -b <local-branch>

**Find out the added commits in this branch**
	
If you create many branches, you usually tend to forget what were the added commits in the local branch.

	git diff <local-branch> ^origin

This command returns all the commits that are there in local-branch but not there in origin.

**Owners of a file**

	git blame path/to/file

I will try to update this list soon!
