My wife and I celebrated our first anniversary trip in French Polynesia (a group of islands south of Hawaii with Bora Bora being the most popular amongst them) after a recommendation from our friend. It is a collection of 118 islands and [atolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoll) amongst which 67 are inhabited. As it is very expensive for most of us, planning a trip to French Polynesia is never easy but we were fortunate to have gotten help from a friend. The goal of this post is to do the same - if you're planning a trip or even considering going there, don't hesitate to reach out :D

For us, there are 3 main reasons to go to French Polynesia to celebrate your special occasion -

1. Nature - [Lagoons](https://www.google.com/search?q=bora+bora), Mountains, sunrises and sunsets - the best we've seen so far.
2. Hospitality - hard to put a price to it.
3. Privacy.

A few notes - 

- Tahiti is the largest of the islands and also has an international airport (currently there are international flights from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Tokyo and Auckland).
- Most of the people we met in French Polynesia were either on their honeymoon or celebrating their anniversary - the hospitality is one of the best here and they make your trip more even more special.
- Moorea and Bora Bora are the most commonly visited islands followed by Taaha or Raiatea.
- Everything is expensive here - tourism is the largest industry here.
- Besides Moorea, you have to take an inter-island flight to visit any other islands. They are super fun and you get incredible views.
- **Moorea** can be reached by a short 45 minute ferry from Tahiti. Besides the blue lagoons, Moorea is also known for the beauty of the island - lush green landscape and beautiful mountains.
- **Bora Bora** is an exotic place mostly visited by couples famous for its over-water bungalows and crystal clear blue lagoon.
