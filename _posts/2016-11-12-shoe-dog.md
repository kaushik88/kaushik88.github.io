*Shoe Dog* is a very candid memoir written by the founder and CEO of Nike - Phil Knight. If you're listening to this in Audible, narration by Norbert Leo But makes it even more enjoyable. It is the story of how Phil Knight at the age of 24 took a crazy idea and turned it into of the world's most recognized brand. They've got a great story and the book has a lot of life quotes. This blog post is about 3 of my favorite quotes from the book - 

> There were many ways down Mount Fuji, according to my guidebook, but only one way up. Life lesson in that, I thought.

> For that matter, few ideas are as crazy as my favorite thing, running. It’s hard. It’s painful. It’s risky. The rewards are few and far from guaranteed. When you run around an oval track, or down an empty road, you have no real destination. At least, none that can fully justify the effort. The act itself becomes the destination.

> And those who urge entrepreneurs to never give up? Charlatans. Sometimes you have to give up. Sometimes knowing when to give up, when to try something else, is genius. Giving up doesn’t mean stopping. Don’t ever stop.

I highly recommend this book, especially to aspiring enterpreneurs and runners.
