Last winter season, a couple of friends and I decided to ski in Tahoe, a 3.5 hour drive from my place. The season pass was a little expensive and we didn't want to add any hotel expenses to that. This meant getting up at 4:30 in the morning, driving for 3.5 hours, ski the whole day and drive back home the same evening. As daunting and tiring as it looked in the beginning, it turned out to be pretty convenient for all of us.

The reason was that we followed a **process** that *eliminated unnecessary decision making* and streamlined it as the season progressed. Towards the end of the season, it looked like this - 

1. Head over to friends house at Walnut Creek the previous night to have 45 minutes of extra sleep.
2. Getup at 5:30 in the morning.
3. Start from house at 6:30 . (I was really amazed at how punctual we were every weekend)
4. Stop at Starbucks in Vacaville for breakfast at around 7:15.
5. Order the same drink and breakfast.
6. Reach Sierra at Tahoe at around 9:30.
7. Ski and meet for lunch at 1 PM.
8. Meet at 4:15 PM for Apres Ski.
9. Start driving back at around 5 PM.

Decision making is tiring as well and the process helps to avoid the unnecessary ones.
