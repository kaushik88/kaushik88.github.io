At dinner, a couple of us were having fun mocking at our friend for eating less. He had been eating the right amount, or from our perspective he was dieting, but was having a tough(er) time doing it eating with us. I quickly imagined myself in his shoes and here are a few things I've done in the past to avoid this - 

1. Take more time to eat your food - People mostly judge you based on the time you take to eat your food. 

2. Eat more number of items (a little bit of everything) - Imagine this to be a dynamic programming Knapsack problem - how do you maximize the number of items to eat while keeping the calorie count within limits.

3. Share food - Since I don't like to waste food, I usually end up sharing food with others. This way it is easier for others to note how much I ate. 

4. I just ate something before - Hard to argue with this.

5. Distract - I usually have a few things to talk about during dinner/lunch and this gives them less time to think about how much food I'm eating.

6. Never go to a buffet - Because it is just a lot harder to do the above things :)
