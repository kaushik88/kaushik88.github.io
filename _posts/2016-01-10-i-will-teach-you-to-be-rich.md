This book is targeted towards people who are starting their careers in the United States. This book has a good breadth on financial topics but doesn't go into depth on any of the topics. Some of the topics covered include - credit score, banking (checking and savings), 401(K), Roth IRA, how to manage your expenses, investments, buying a car, home etc. If any of the above topics sound new/interesting to you, chances are you'll learn something from this book to get started and save a few bucks.

This blog post is my key learnings from the book **I will teach you to be rich** by Ramit Sethi.

##Key Learnings

In each of the learnings, I've added a section called *Action Item* - something to take it forward besides reading the book/blog.

###Credit Score

Credit Score is based on the following 5 factors
	
* 35% Payment History (late payments hurt you)	

* 30% credit utilization rate (credit bill/credit limit)

* 15% length of history

* 10% new credit

* 10% types of credit (loans, credit cards etc. variety is better)

**Action Items** 

* Setup automatic credit card payments (I actually didn't know this!). For Bank Of America, you can setup automatic credit card payments in full here - https://choosedirectdebit.bankofamerica.com/ .

* Increase your credit limit - This is related to the 2nd factor (credit utilization rate). Higher your credit limit, the lower your utilization rate.

###Bank Accounts

The big banks like Bank of America and Wells Fargo have a very low interest on the savings account (for example, Bank of America has a 0.01% APY) and 0% interest on the checkings account. 

**Action Items** 

* Open a High Yield Savings Account - Do some research online and find out the top yielding savings account. At the time of writing, I've found some banks to give close to 1% interest. I've been using **Barclays Savings account**.

* Setup automatic monthly transfers.

###Managing your expenses
	
{% include figure.html path="blog/personal/spending.png" alt="Spending Template" %}

As they say, *'If you cannot measure it, you can't manage it.'* This is one of the templates mentioned in the book. The most important thing that I like about the above template is that it allocates 20% to 35% towards guilt-free spending on things you love (read skis, shoes, sports lessons etc.) :) Feel free to modify the template to suit your needs.	

**Action Items**

* Track your spendings - There are many apps/tools to track your monthly expenses. I've been using **saver** - an [app for iPhone](http://saverapp.co/).	

###Investment

{% include figure.html path="blog/personal/swensen.png" alt="Swensen's Asset Allocation" %}

The Swensen model of Asset Allocation- 

* 30% Domestic Equities - Total Market Index (VTSMX)

* 15% Developed world international equities - Total International Stock Index (VGTSX)

* 20% Real Estate Funds - REIT Index (VGSIX)

* 15% Treasury Inflation protected securities - TIPS Bond Index (VIPSX)

* 15% Government bonds - US Treasury Bond Index (VFISX) + Intermediate-Term Treasury Fund (VFITX) + Long-Term Treasury Fund (VUSTX)

* 5% Emerging Market Equities - VEIEX

**Action Items**
		
* Enroll in 401(K) - atleast whatever your employer matches.

* Enroll in Roth IRA if you're eligible.

* Open a personal investment account (I use Vanguard) and start investing :)

As you can tell, none of this is cool or sexy but helpes you save a lot of money in the long term. The title is cheesy but I promise the content is much better :)
