You read the name right (or if you read it as **Roger** Federer, you might want to read the title again). The blog post is about Roger Federer's dad, Robert.

Try to observe the guy with the red hat (left side of your screen) in the following video -

It was the 2008 Wimbledon Final (still regarded as one of the best matches in Tennis history). Nadal had just defeated Federer on grass and stopped Federer from winning his 6th consecutive Wimbledon title. It would also mean that Nadal would be the new world No. 1, stealing it from Federer. Even till date, this was one of the most painful losses for Federer.

And yet, for the entire duration Robert was giving Nadal a standing ovation and seemed truly happy for him. He even helped Nadal get to where his family and team was standing. One must understand that unlike most things in life, Tennis is a zero-sum game (For Nadal to keep winning, Federer has to lose).
