The journey of learning a new skill is an interesting one. There's a lot of similarity in all our journeys and understanding that is helpful in overcoming the challenges. In the book **Self Leadership and the One Minute Manager**, Ken Blanchard talks about the different stages, the challenges you face in them and how you can overcome them.

### Enthusiastic Beginner 

I've just started to learn swimming now. As an enthusiastic beginner, I'm excited about the end result but I do not know what it takes to get there. I'm still a beginner but I'm highly committed to get better. In order to get through this stage, I need direction on how I could become a better swimmer.

**What you have** - Energy and commitment. <br/>
**What you need** - Direction.

### Disillusioned Learner

This is the most difficult stage and a lot of people tend to drop out in this stage. The excitement of how awesome and fun swimming is have ended and the reality of how difficult swimming is kicks in. The energy level has gone down and the competence level has gone up but unfortunately only marginally better. I'm a better swimmer now than a few weeks ago but I'm not good enough to enjoy swimming. In order to get through this stage, I need direction on how I could get better and I also need support (as the energy level has gone down).

**What you need** - Direction and Support. <br/>

### Cautious Performer

You've done all the hardwork - you've learnt the techniques and you've gained moderate competence level. However, you're still not an expert and in order to become one, you need a lot of practice. In order to get through this stage, you need people of similar skill level to give you the support/practice you need.

**What you have** - Competence. <br/>
**What you need** - Commitment and Support.

### High Achiever

You've mastered the skill and maybe it is time to pass on the knowledge to someone else :)

**What you have** - High competence and high commitment. <br/>
**What you need to do** - Delegate.
