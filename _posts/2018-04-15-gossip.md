In the light of the recent Facebook's recent Cambridge Analytica data breach, I can't help but notice it's similarity to Gossip.

> I shared something with a friend of mine but my friend shared that with other people without my permission.
<br/>
> My friend came to know that my data was breached but didn't report it back to me.

**Facebook is your friend who gossips!**

### Cheap way to make Friendship

The hard way to make friendship is to share common interest/activity or to help each other grow. However, that takes a lot of time and effort. 

> Gossip is a quick way to make a connection with someone. It makes us look popular and cool.

### Gossip is mostly a Projection of yourself

If I gossip, I am showing that I cannot be trusted. <br/>

If I gossip, I am spending time on things that I cannot change (other people's actions). <br/>

If I'm listening to someone who gossips, I am judging other people (based on someone else's opinion) before hearing their thoughts.

> Gossip is mostly projection - which means you should be careful what you say about others. You are actually talking about yourself.
