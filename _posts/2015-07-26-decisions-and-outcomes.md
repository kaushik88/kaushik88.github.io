A few years ago, a couple of friends and I had taken Poker lessons. The Poker instructor was very passionate about Poker and he drew many parallels between Poker and Life. Somehow, this quote of his - "**For every life lesson, there is a similar Poker analogy**" has stuck with me over the years and this blog post is about one such analogy.

> *Don't confuse bad results with bad decisions.*

Poker is a game where one needs to make decisions based on information. Sometimes, it is possible to make a good decision and yet have a bad result - you could raise money with a pair of A's and yet lose the pot. It is important to not get discouraged or distracted with the bad result and focus on making good decisions time and again. In the long run, it all evens out and good decisions will lead to good outcomes (always).

Always remember that the result or outcome is not in our hands - what we control is our decision!
