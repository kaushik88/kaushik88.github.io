I've always wondered what's going inside a Tennis player's head (especialy Murray/Djokovic/Federer) during the big points on big matches. I might have to wait for their biographies to find out but I stumbled upon Andy Murray's on-court motivational notes on the Internet.

1. Be good to yourself. <br/>
2. Try your best. <br/>
3. Be intense with your legs. <br/>
4. Be proactive during points. <br/>
5. Focus on each point and the process. <br/>

A couple of notes on them - 

1. **Keep it Simple** - I like the fact that he kept it **simple** and thus making it easy to execute. I believe the note is divided into 2 - the first 5 are applicable to any sports person and the next 5 are specific to his opponent - Nicholas Mahut.

2. **Write it down** - He wrote it down and kept it at a place to make sure he'd read them at the changeover.
