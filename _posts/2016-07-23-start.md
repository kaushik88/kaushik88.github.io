If everything has to be perfect from the moment go, then you're never going to get off the ground. Monika Hardy defines one framework to get started - *Notice, Dream, Connect, Do*.

We fail to *notice* because we're busy keeping busy.

We fail to *dream* because dreaming implies that we have to take a risk to realize our dreams.

We fail to *connect* because we might get rejected.

We fail to *do* because we haven't noticed, we haven't dreamed and we haven't connected.
