Food was one of my biggest hesitations in camping and backpacking. But after trying out some of the stuffs, I certainly believe you don't have to sacrifice on the food while backpacking or camping. This blog post is about what I liked or didn't like.

*Disclaimer - I'm vegetarian*

### Breakfast Food

The breakfast food that we had bought from REI were really good - 

1. [Granola with Milk and Blueberries](https://www.rei.com/product/510121/mountain-house-granola-with-milk-and-blueberries-2-servings) - Cold cereal.
2. [Granola with Milk and Bananas](https://www.rei.com/product/101428/backpackers-pantry-granola-with-milk-and-bananas-2-servings) - Hot, high in calories and yumm.

### Indian Breads

We had got Indian breads from [Chaat Bhavan](https://www.yelp.com/biz/chaat-bhavan-sunnyvale) in Sunnyvale. These breads don't need any heating and last for 3 days without refrigerating. 

1. Methi Theplas
2. Methi Parathas
3. Plain Parathas

They're a little bland without the curry but passable. The best part is that you don't have to stop and prepare them to eat - you can eat them as you hike.

### Freeze-Dried Food

**Likes**

1. [Pad Thai](https://www.rei.com/product/711288/backpackers-pantry-pad-thai-veggie-2-servings) - Good flavors.
2. [Curry In a Hurry](https://www.rei.com/product/760585/maryjanesfarm-organic-curry-in-a-hurry-single-serving) - Didn't have the artificial flavor you usually have in packaged food.
3. [Herbed Mushroom Risotto](https://www.rei.com/product/885695/good-to-go-herbed-mushroom-risotto-2-servings)
4. [Lentils, Rice and Indian Spice](https://www.rei.com/product/760588/maryjanesfarm-organic-lentils-rice-and-indian-spice-single-serving) - This was passable.

**Dislikes**

1. [Channa Masala](https://www.rei.com/product/769060/backpackers-pantry-chana-masala-2-servings) - Meh. Some of us liked it thought.
2. [Indian Vegetable Korma](https://www.rei.com/product/106096/good-to-go-indian-vegetable-korma-2-servings) - Really bland.
