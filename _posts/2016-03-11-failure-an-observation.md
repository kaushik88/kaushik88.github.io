A minor disappointment today got me thinking about the different ways I've reacted and observed others react to them before. The list below in random order - 

**Deny** - What failure? :P

**Criticize** - If I'm going down, I'm taking everybody with me!

**Blame** - Based on my observation, this is probably the most common reaction to failure - it is easy, makes you feel better and we all love doing it.

**Sympathize** - So what I failed in X, *atleast* I'm successful in A,B and C.

**Share** - This works to some extent - if you don't overdo it and if you're willing to accept feedback!

**Hide** - I'm ashamed and I don't want to meet or talk to anyone right now!

**Abscond** - Depending on the magnitude, this could mean taking a vacation or moving to a new place or in some cases just going out.

**Distract** - Distract yourself from being bogged down - the distraction could either be a positive distraction (hitting the gym or focusing on work) or a negative one (well, you know!!).

**Compensate** - Compensate the failure in one field with a success in another.

**Observe** - Observing your own failure means treating it like a third-person *case-study*, taking notes and then moving on. This is the first time I've done this and I can certainly say that I feel a lot better!
