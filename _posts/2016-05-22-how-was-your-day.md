Three years ago, I went on a 7 day trip with my school friends. It was a long trip and on the last day as we were driving to the airport, my friend asked us a simple question - **What were your favorite moments from the trip?**. Despite it's simplicity, I remember this moment for many reasons.

First, it led to a fun conversation and we got to know what were the favorite moments for each of one us (surprisingly, it was different for every one). Second, and more importantly, it put a positive thought in my head about the trip. There were a lot of good moments from the trip and a few dull ones too. Sometimes, it is easy to focus on the not so good memories but this conversation helped to put things in perspective.

*Strangely, as I look back on this trip, this conversation at the airport towards the end of the trip would be my favorite moment.*

Every time I have a bad day, I ask the question to myself - **How was your day?** or in other words **What are your favorite moments of the day?**. More often than not, I end up feeling better about the day than I had originally thought!
