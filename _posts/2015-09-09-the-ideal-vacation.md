On the flight back from a 5 day vacation to the Yellowstone National Park, I was reflecting on the various kinds of vacation and what works for each one of us. Hope this blog post helps you figure out what is the kind of your next ideal vacation. 

**By Budget**

1. Pocket Friendly - Eating at McDonalds and staying in Motel6.
2. Luxury - Staying at Five star hotels with breakfast buffets.

**By Type**

1. Adventurous - Think of Bungee jumping, skydiving etc.
2. Touristy - Visit all the top tourist spots listed on TripAdvisor.
3. Catch up with People - I don't care what places I visit - just want to have a good conversation with friends.
4. Rest - Stay at home and relax :)

**By People**

1. Alone - Figuring out more about yourself.
2. With your partner - Romance.
3. With a small set of friends - Catching up, good conversations.
4. Family - Memorable.
5. Large group - Making new friends, having lots of fun :)

**By Schedule**
1. Packed - Getup at 8 AM, visit as many tourist places as possible and return around midnight.
2. Relaxed - No plan, just take it as it comes.

Our Facebook lives demand us to stay *cool* or *hip* and this requires a certain kind of travel - being adventurous, visiting all the tourist spots and taking a lot of profile pictures. However, our real lives **might* demand something different and this depends on various factors - the people you're travelling with, the kind of personality you're and also the circumstances in your life.

If you don't want to visit all the tourist spots and just have a good conversation with your friends, that is ok. If you want to just spend all your vacation resting at home, that is ok too. Find your kind of ideal vacation and happy travelling :)
