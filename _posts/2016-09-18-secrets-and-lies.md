In his book *The Road Less Travelled*, Scott Peck talks about two types of lies - white lies and black lies. <br/>

A **black lie** is a statement we make that we know is false. <br/>
A **white lie** is a statement we make that in itself is not false but leaves out a significant part of the truth. <br/>

White lies are the **most common** form of lying - as they may seem reprehensible. Since they're harder to detect and confront, they're more **pernicious** than black-lying. This blog post is about white lies.

> Honesty is freedom.

### White Lies

* They always **take a toll** on you. You've to mentally keep track of all the lies you've told from time to time and it's hard to be your authentic self with all the secrets and lies. Your close ones would notice it

* Protection - deprivation - anyways revealed.

* In some scenarios, it is actually **necessary** to withhold information from others - in the field of psychotherapy, politics, medicine, law and other fields.

### When Is It Ok to Lie?

* With that being said, the decision to withhold the truth should never be based on personal needs such as the need for power, the need to be liked or more importantly the **fear of confrontation**.

* The most common excuse for white lies is **I don't want to trouble/hurt others with my issues** while the actual reason could be **fear of confrontation**.

* It has to be remembered that when assessing the capacity of another to utilize or accept the truth, we usually tend to underestimate rather than overestimate.

Honesty gives you the freedom to be who you are. <br/>
Honesty gives you the freedom to grow and build strong relationships. <br/>
Honesty gives you the freedom to not hide.
