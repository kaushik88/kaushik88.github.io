The excuse I use most often to convince myself for not doing an activity is *"I am not good at it"*. However, this has become a default excuse for a lot of things -  small talk, vegetable cutting, swimming, yoga, public speaking, house cleaning, taking care of health and the list goes on!

Barring a few things that I don't want to get better at, *I'm not good at it* is not an excuse at all. It implies that I also don't want to get better at it as practice is the most effective way to get better at something. Next time, avoid the excuse and see it as an opportunity to get better at something :)
