When a friend comes and asks you for information, how you'd respond most of the time determines your reciprocity style -

- **Givers** are happy to share the information without expecting anything in return.
- **Matchers** would help only if they expect something in return.
- **Takers** guard their information and think that they are at an advantage over their friends.

We all have been givers, matchers and takers in different situations in our lives. This blog post is about learning the difference between Givers and Takers.

**Mentality**

- A taker's mentality is usually - *What's in it for me?*.
- A giver's mentality is usually - *I'd be happy to help and I don't expect anything in return*.

**Values**

- Takers favor values like **wealth** (money and material possessions), **power** (dominance and control over others) and **winning** (doing better than others).
- Givers favor values like **Helpfulness** (working for the well-being of others), **Responsibility** (being dependable), **Social Justice** (caring for disadvantaged) and **Compassion** (responding to the needs of others).

**Self-focused vs Other-Focused**

- Takers are **self-focused** and always put their own interests ahead of others.
- Givers are **other-focused** and always think what others need from them.

**Short-Term vs Long-Term**

- Takers think **short-term** - their main focus is on winning short-term even if it comes at some long-term cost like relationship health.
- Givers think **long-term** - they are willing to let go of short-term wins if it is good for the long-term. 

**How they see the world**

- Takers believe that the world is a competitive, **dog-eats-dog** place. They feel that success is being better than others.
- Givers don't see life as a zero-sum game and believe we all can **help each other win** our own game.

**How others see them**

- Takers are good **fakers** - extremely friendly in the short-term but cunning and selfish in the long-term.
- Givers are stereotyped as chumps or doormats.

**Winning Strategy**

- Takers follow a **win-lose** strategy. When takers win, someone else loses.
- Givers try to optimize for a **win-win** strategy. When givers win, everybody else wants them to win.

**How they treat others**

- Takers **kiss up** and **kick down**.
- Givers are very friendly to those in need of help.

**Found In**

- Givers are very common in marriages and close friendships.
- Takers are very common.
