[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a workplace collaboration tool for businesses. I've been using Slack at my current company for about a year now and it has definitely made me more productive. While there are a lot of features of Slack that I would love to talk about, this blog post is about one aspect of their culture - **humor**.

As I updated the *Slack* app on my iPhone today, I noticed their update message -

While most of the other applications have messages which just say *"Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements."* and hide their bugs, Slack have been upfront in highlighting their bugs with humor. As I thought about it, they had humor in their name too - being named *Slack* for a productivity tool :D. 

A few notes on this - 

* It shows that they're willing to accept that they're not perfect. It keeps them humble and grounded.

* It is really easy to mock at your strengths by falsely portraying them as a weakness - for example a really strong person with muscular arms self-mocking after missing a day at the gym. However, it takes confidence, courage and practice to mock at yourself (more specifically your weakness) without making others uncomfortable.

* It shows that they're open and honest. 

And more importantly, I'm guessing a fun place to work!
