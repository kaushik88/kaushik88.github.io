I've been using the HBO app on my iPhone a lot recently and this blogpost is about my thoughts on what could be done to improve the user experience.

1. **Binge Watching** - Some of the things that could be done to make it easier to binge-watch :

	* Automatically play the next episode when I'm done with the current episode.

	* Easy navigation to the TV series home if I'm watching a particular episode. I constantly had to search for the TV series again and then navigate within that to the next or previous episode.

2. **Viewing History** - It would be great to have a viewing history - a list of videos (categorized by the TV series name and not the episode name) sorted in the decreasing order of viewing time.

3. **Personalization** -  Some of the simple personalization ideas to start off with - 

	* Preferences and Recommendations - Understand the user's preferences (explicitly or implicitly) and recommend movies or TV shows based on it.

	* People Also Viewed - To start off with this can be as simple as grouping by genre or TV series but then could get more complicated using co-views in a session.

I understand that they're not a Tech company but if they're competing with the likes of Netflix, they've to do a lot better!
