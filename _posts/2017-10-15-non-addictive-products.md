Imagine a future where there is a *right* amount of consumption for the technical products we use. Just like a doctor would prescribe you to take [Paracetamol](https://www.drugs.com/paracetamol.html) twice a day (once after lunch and once after dinner) or a Nutritionist might ask you to consume only 20g of fat a day, an *Application Developer* would recommend you to consume the app not more than 15 minutes a day. In fact, Apple has taken a small step towards the future through its *Driving Mode* in the iOS 11 release. 

The **Driving Mode** is a feature on iOS11 where your phone is automatically put to a **Do Not Disturb** mode when you're driving - you'll not receive any notifications on your phone and you'll need an additional click to unlock your phone. Here's what it looks like -

If I've to play Devil's Advocate, here are 3 things that are **wrong** with this feature - 

* The phone locks even for the passengers in the car and hence it is annoying (a.k.a. an additional click) for them to use the phone.

* If the driver really wanted to use the phone during driving, this just adds an additional step to it.

* Any of the engagement metrics that Apple Product Managers are tracking, I believe this would be a negative change.

Yet, this has helped me not check my phone while driving and I've almost completely stopped checking my phone. I sincerely thank the good soul who came up with this idea. Even if this feature might be annoying to thousands of people, it has a huge positive impact to a few hundreds like me and could potentially save a life.

Here's me wishing a similar Product Feature in some of the other products that I use and here are the 3 obvious ideas I could think of - 

**Facebook Dinner Mode** - A feature called *Dinner Mode*. You're at a dinner table with your friends/family. Do you want to be check Facebook Feed right now?

**YouTube/Netflix Sleep Mode** - A feature called *Sleep Mode*. You've watched more than 5 videos by just clicking on the *Watch Next* feature but it's time to sleep now!

**Amazon Shopaholic Mode** - A feature called *Shopaholic Mode*. You've spent a lot of money this month, are you sure you want to buy more items? 

Now that we've imagined such a future, do we really need the tech companies to build them for us?
