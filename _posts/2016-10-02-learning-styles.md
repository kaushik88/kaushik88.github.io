A couple of weeks ago, a friend and I were discussing about how people learn a new skill or technique. Learning is one way to make sure you continuously **grow** and if you can learn how to learn, then you could essentially get good at anything you set your sights on (over a period of time of course). We identified 3 different learning styles (I'm sure there are many more) and this blog post is my takeaway from that conversation. I'll use **Tennis** as an example in this blog post, but this applies to any kind of learning - learning to play a Guitar, learning to speak a new language or learning something technical for your work.

**Self-Learners** -  They are the people who can watch YouTube Tennis Lesson videos and become a professional Tennis player (say level 5) quickly. They are what we call the *Genius* or the *Highly Self-Motivated* Individuals. They've great discipline to schedule their learnings and have the talent to apply their learnings on the court.

**Students** - They start learning by hiring a Tennis coach to teach the fundamentals - the various grips, how to hit a forehand, a backhand and how to serve. By the end of the lessons, they would have reached a point from where where they can pick it up on their own. The **advantage** with this approach is that you get to learn things the right way from the start. However, this style requires you to make a big payment initially and you must also make sure you pick the right coach.

**Self-Learners and then Students** - These people start by watching YouTube Tennis lessons and practicing with their friends. However, unlike the first category they soon hit a wall - they're not improving as much as they would like to. Hence they hire a Tennis Coach to take their game to the next level. The advantage with this style is that you get to check your interest level before you make a huge payment. The downside with this approach is that the Tennis coach might probably ask you to *unlearn* all the hacks you've learnt previously.

So, what's your learning style?

P.S. A friend of mine also recommended me the Coursera course [*Learning How To Learn*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). You might want to check it out to learn more :)
