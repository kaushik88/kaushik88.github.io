There's a scene in Game of Thrones Season 1 Episode 4 between Ned and Arya Stark - <br/>

*Ned* - One day you'll marry a high Lord and rule his castle and your sons shall be knights and princes and Lords. <br/>

The picture that Ned has painted for Arya is a pretty picture (for some) and it is the norm. However, Arya doesn't relate to this and wants to be a fighter. Without any fuss, she says *"no, that's not me"* and continues practicing for her sword fighting lesson.

We're all unique and have our own values. While it is easy to follow the crowd, it takes determination and courage to stand-up for your values and say *That's Not Me*.
