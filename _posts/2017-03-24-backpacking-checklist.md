A checklist on what to carry - 

### Individual Stuffs

1. Backpack - For a 3 day camping trip, we had a 65L or 70L backpack.
2. Sleeping Bag - I'd recommend carrying a sleeping back 20F lesser than the minimum temperature.
3. Sleeping Pad - Good for your back.
4. Hiking Boots - The boots give you more ankle support but some of us had hiking shoes and they were fine too. I had a [Vasque Breeze III Mid-Hiking Boots](https://www.rei.com/product/109017/vasque-breeze-iii-mid-gtx-hiking-boots-mens) and they were great.
5. Water Shoes - I'd recommend hiking in the water with sandals - something like [this](http://www.columbia.com/techsun-vent-%7C-231-%7C-12-887921755291.html). Some us had water shoes but then sand or tiny pebbles would get stuck in the water shoes. 
6. Clothing - I'd recommend only 1 additional pair of clothing (besides the one you're wearing) for a 3 day trip. Convertible Pants are really convenient - [Columbia Silver Ridge Convertible Pant](http://www.columbia.com/silver-ridge-convertible-pant-%7C-160-%7C-32-886108139510.html) or the [Mountain Hardwear Mesa Convertible Pants](http://www.mountainhardwear.com/mens-mesa-convertible-ii-pant-1649001.html). Also, don't wear any cotton top - preferably any material that wicks sweat (any of the sports wear should do).
7. Socks - Don't wear cotton socks. We had [Darn Tough socks](https://darntough.com/collections/mens-hike-trek/products/coolmax-coolmax-micro-crew-cushion) and they were really comfortable throughout the trip.
8. Battery Charger - To make sure your phone never runs out of battery and you could take a lot of photos, carry something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-bar-Sized-Portable-High-Speed-Technology/dp/B00P7N0320).
9. Food - Check out my earlier [post](http://kaushik88.github.io/blog/2017/03/23/camping-food/).
10. Water Bottle / Hydration Bladder - All of us carried a [2L hydration bladder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006JYHFJA/ref=twister_B00P7MYS6I?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) for carrying water and a water bottle for Gatorade or electrolyte.
11. Headlamp - I'd recommend [this](https://www.amazon.com/Headlamp-Headlight-Battery-Batteries-Included/dp/B005FEGYJC/) over a torch light (good to have your hands free).
12. Ponchos - Just in case it rains.
13. Hiking Poles
14. Cap and Sunglasses - really helpful!!
15. Towel
16. Tooth-Brush, Paste and other accessories
17. Bio-Degradable Soap - We carried [these](https://www.rei.com/product/862429/sea-to-summit-wilderness-wash-soap-3-fl-oz).
18. Hand Sanitizer, Toilet Paper and Face wipes.
19. Water Filter - to filter water but we ended up directly drinking from the tap water in the campgrounds.
20. Pocket Knife
21. Cord - Comes in handy for a lot of things (hanging clothes or tying)

### Group Stuffs

1. Tents - REI rentals.
2. First Aid Kit.
3. BugSpray.
4. Sunscreen.
5. Trash Bags
6. Fuel Cannister, Lighter, Stove and Kitchen Utensils - REI rentals.
7. Cards, Small Speakers and Board Games - for entertainment :)

I'm sure I might have missed something but this is a good list to start with.
