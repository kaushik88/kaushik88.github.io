I started reading [this](www.amazon.com/Hatching-Twitter-Story-Friendship-Betrayal/dp/1591847087/ref=sr_1_1) book expecting a startup story - business decisions, growth strategies, hiring decisions, the business ideas that worked and more importantly the ones that didn't work. I was expecting something like [The Everything store](www.amazon.com/Everything-Store-Jeff-Bezos-Amazon/dp/0316219282/ref=sr_1_1) on Amazon or [In the Plex](www.amazon.com/Plex-Google-Thinks-Works-Shapes/dp/1416596585/ref=sr_1_1) on Google

However, this book turned out to be more about  how the co-founders betrayed each other, their ego clashes and the drama surrounding that. I was a little disappointed but if you like office gossip and drama, this is a great read! My key learning from this book is based on the ego clash between Ev and Jack.

### Ego

Ev and Jack had fundamentally different views of what Twitter was and each of them tried to build *their* version of Twitter. Jack saw Twitter as a **status updater** - a place to say where *he* was and what *he* was doing, a place to display yourself and your ego to your followers. Ev, being a shy person, saw Twitter as a medium to share where *other people* were and what the *other people* were doing.

I know this might sound trivial but is fundamental in shaping the vision of Twitter - Jack's vision saw twitter as a **status updater** whereas Ev visioned Twitter to be a real-time **news site**. In fact, one of the first decisions that Ev made after taking over as the CEO of Twitter from Jack was to change the text in the Twitter text box from *'What're you doing?'* to *'What's happening?'*.

I felt they failed to set aside their egos to vision what's best for Twitter. In reality, Twitter was both a status updater and a news site - one would have never worked without the other. A simple status updater in 140-character posts was too egotistical to be sustainable. A news updater in 140-character spurts was just a glorified newswire. The two together is what made it a great success!

*Side Note* - As I write this, 5 executives (the head of Product, Engineering, Marketing, HR and one of the Vine cofounders) from Twitter have decided *to leave* the company on the same day. There's probably more to the story than the one that we read in the press and hopefully another book on Twitter can cover that :)
