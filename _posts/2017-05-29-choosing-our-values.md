### Why Should we choose our Values?

Why do we want to choose our values? If you're asking this question, chances are that you've already chosen them but not realized it yet.

> Our values determine the metrics by which we measure ourselves and everyone else.

{% include figure.html path="blog/personal/values.jpg" alt="Values quote by Roy Disney" caption="Source" url="http://img.picturequotes.com/2/41/40302/its-not-hard-to-make-decisions-when-you-know-what-your-values-are-quote-1.jpg" %}

It is how we consider ourselves (our actions) as a failure or a success.

* If you envy your friends because they have bought a new house, then you've chosen the value of *Material Success*. The metrics that determine your success would be your material possessions - your house, car, gold etc.

* If you are jealous of the most popular person in the class, then you've chosen the value of *Popularity*. The metrics that determine your success would be the number of likes on Facebook for your profile picture (for example).

* If you admire the creativity of another person at your work, then you've chosen the value of *Creativity*. 

### Characteristics of Good Values

If you decide to choose your values, here are 3 characteristics of a good value to help you out - 

1. **Reality Based** - A good value is based on reality. Consider the example of *popularity* and the metric being the most popular in class. It is not a good value as you may feel that you're very popular in class but in reality, you've no idea what others think about it. On the other hand, *Honesty* is a good value - you know whether or not you've been honest.

2. **Socially Constructive** - Honesty, creativity, demanding excellence are some examples of good values that benefit others. 

3. **Controllable** - Most of the good values are achieved internally. If you want to be honest, you can be honest - you don't need anyone else.
