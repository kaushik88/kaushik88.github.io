A couple of weeks ago, I was playing in a badminton doubles league and I found myself in a tough situation - someone in the top-ranked group (professional) didn't make it that day and hence I (an amateur) was asked to take his spot. I played 5 matches and I lost (the word 'lost' would be an understatement and 'thrashed' would be more appropriate) all of them - 7-21, 9-21, 8-21, 11-21 and 9-21. Incidently, my last blog post was about various reactions to Losses - *deny, crticize, blame, sympathize, share, hide, abscond, distract, compensate and observe*. This blog post is how I realized that I've missed a couple of reactions from that list.

**Learn** - The expectations were really low and I got to play freely. I quickly switched from the *compete* mode to *learn* mode. After every match, I would quickly have a chat with the rest to see if I can learn a technique or two - most people were kind enough to share a quick tip.

**Enjoy** - Once in a while, you might get a perfect opportunity where you dash from the left service court to the right and hit the perfect cross-court drop shot - the opponents just watching the bird without moving an inch. That moment is completely worth it!
