The Game of Thrones Season 6 finale just ended. I believe the background score in Game of Thrones doesn't get talked about as much as it should but the recent episode had some great background score and the sound track below has been trending in both Spotify and iTunes.

Happy mid-week and hope this helps to get some [work done](http://kaushik88.github.io/blog/2016/05/31/music-for-productivity/) before the long weekend :)
