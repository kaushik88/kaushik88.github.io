I was having dinner with a couple of friends and after I thanked them for cooking and inviting me for the lovely meal, they asked me why I was being so formal. This was not the first time someone had said this to me. A couple of thoughts on this - 

1. Never thank someone when you don't mean it - don't be formal. That way, it means a lot more when you say it.

2. Never take people for granted, especially your close ones. Thank them when they take time or make an effort for you - not because they need it or they expect it but because you should!
