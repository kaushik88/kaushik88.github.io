I was having dinner with a couple of friends and after I thanked them for cooking and inviting me for the lovely meal, they asked me why I was being so formal. It got me thinking and a couple of thoughts on this - 

1. Never say the two words when you don't mean it - don't be formal.

2. Never take people for granted, especially your close ones. Thank them when they take time for you - not because they need it or they expect it but because you should!
