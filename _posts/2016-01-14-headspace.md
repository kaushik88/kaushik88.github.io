A little over 7 months ago, a friend of mine recommended me [this](https://www.headspace.com) meditation app. I had given it a try once before but kept falling asleep. I decided to try this one more time and after about a month, it was starting to become the first thing I do every morning.

However, like all habits I was curious to check if I was doing it correctly or if I was making any progress. For example, the time I started to run, I was able to make some progress in a month - I could run longer and faster than I used to 30 days ago. The same thing could be said about most of the other habits - sports, skiing, lifting weights etc. And for each of them, I was able to come up with a metric that can help me track my progress.

Interestingly, I wasn't able to come up with one for meditation/headspace and yet I felt good about using it everyday. I was discussing this with a friend of mine and we came up with a couple of reasons - 

1. **Takes Time** - It is a lifetime journey hence it might months/years to have a larger imapact to your personality.

2. **Hard to measure** - Certain things are hard to measure and represent as a metric and probably those are the things that are the most important in our lives.

I've been using this app for about 7 months now (missed a few days here and there) and I'm just beginning to appreciate it's benefits. Just to be clear, this is not magic and doesn't mean you'll never get stressed, anxious, frustrated or angry. But I'm certain that you'll begin your day with a sense of calm and a smile on your face.
