In **Open: An Autobiography**, Andre Agassi shared a secret with us after winning his first Grand Slam at Wimbledon in 1992.

> But I don't feel that winning a Wimbledon has changed me. I feel, in fact, as if I've been let in on a dirty little secret: winning changes nothing. Now that I've won a slam, I know something that very few people on earth are permitted to now. A win doesn't feel as good as a loss feels bad, and the good feeling doesn't last as long as the bad. Not even close.

Despite knowing this, the only reason people are so competitive and passionate is because they love what they do - they enjoy the journey and learn from the process. So, next time you set your sight on something, instead of asking the question *Can I win?*, ask the question *Can I learn* from this process!
