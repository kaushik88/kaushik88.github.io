A common strategy in business dealings, negotiations and even in relationships is *play hard to get*. It is not hard to see why - by playing hard to get, you increase your desirability in the short term and eventually you might end up getting what you want or sometimes even more. This blog post is my take on this topic.

Don't play hard to get! In fact, don't play at all!

* If you've got a good business deal - thank the concerned people.

* If you really like your new job role - let the recruiter know and don't negotiate by playing it down.

* If you like some one, state it strong and clear - don't try to hint at something someone else has to try to read.

While this might not get you a better deal or a salary in the short term, you'll be able maintain  healthier relationships and this always works in the long term. Of course, this **assumes** that the other person appreciates you for being upfront and doesn't take advantage of that. And when they do, you get better at choosing the right person the next time.
