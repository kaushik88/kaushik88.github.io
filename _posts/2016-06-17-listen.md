I was driving and having a conversation with a friend of mine and after a few seconds, I zoned out. I was preoccupied with another issue and my mind got distracted. Then, I heard a comment - *"You've become a terrible listener"*. As soon as I heard it, I knew it was true and I didn't argue back. This blog post is a collection of self-notes on how to be a better listener.

* Don't interrupt - Even if you think you know how they're going to complete the sentence, let them finish. It is not your turn yet!

* Be Open to the Possibility that your assumptions and the world-view could be wrong.

* Ask more questions - Clarify your assumptions.

* Turn off all distractions - No cell-phones, laptop or TV. Preferably **walk and talk**.

* Postpone when preoccupied or tired.
