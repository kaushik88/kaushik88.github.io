Today, I got back to work after a long weekend and the first few minutes were difficult to immediately get the concentration going. But then, I put on my headphones and listened to a couple of songs and then slowly things started to get better and soon back to normal.

As I thought about the kind of music I usually listen to while working, 3 characteristics stood out - 

1. No lyrics (or very minimal).

2. Monotonous or Repetitive music.

3. Songs that I don't really care about.

Thanks to AR Rahman for the many hours of productivity! A couple of songs from my productivity play-list -
