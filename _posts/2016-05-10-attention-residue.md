In his book Deep Work, Cal Newport talks about the concept of **Attention Residue**. When we switch from Task A to Task B, the attention usually doesn't immediately follow, a residue of our attention remains stuck thinking about Task A. The concept of Attention Residue was first introduced by Sophie Leroy in her research paper, [Why is it so hard to do my work](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597809000399).

Based on her research, Sophie claimed that the residue is thicker if our work on Task A, before swithcing to Task B, is any of the following *unbounded, low intensity (binge watching or mindless internet browsing) and incomplete*. The intensity of focus on the next task reduces as the attention residue thickens.

> Quality of work = (Intensity of focus * Time Spent)

In order to verify her theory, she conducted an experiement. She invited 2 groups of students to the lab and asked them to perform a couple of tasks - a **word puzzle** followed by **resume screening**. The first group was allowed to complete the word puzzle whereas the second group were asked to switch to resume screening half-way through the puzzle. When she measured the performance of these students on the second task - the results were clear. The group of students who were allowed to complete the puzzle had a lower attention residue and thus performed better compared to the other group.
