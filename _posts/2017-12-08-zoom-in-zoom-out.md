Imagine having a DSLR camera to click a wide landscape photo. While you zoom in to identify objects and understand them, you zoom out (or look away from the camera lens) to put them in perspective with other objects. In most cases, you only click the photo after you zoom out. **Solving problems** in our real life follows a similar philosophy.

You first have to zoom in to detect, analyze and understand the problems. Zooming-in is important - it is what helps you understand your problems. However, in order to add perspective to your problem, it is important to zoom-out by asking yourself <br/> - 

1. *Will I be thinking about this a week from now? How about a month or a year or 5 years?* <br/>
2. You can also zoom out by looking back at the problems you've had in the past. 

> When we look back at our problems, they always are smaller than they appear.
