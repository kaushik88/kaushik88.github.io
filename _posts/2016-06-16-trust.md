Trust is often the core of any relationship, personal or professional, and the only way to establish trust is to be consistent between what you say and what you do. One of the most simple and best definitions of trust that I've heard is -

A few random thoughts on this - 

1. Trust is not achieved by 1 big gesture but rather by a collection of small actions over time.

2. It is naturally hard to trust a **new person** when it is a *win* situation for the other person. An ideal example for this would be when a car salesman tells you that there is a really good deal on the new BMW 5 series.

3. Trust, once broken, can be established again but it is just a lot harder and takes longer.
