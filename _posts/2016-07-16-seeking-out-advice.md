There's a lot of free (and bad) advice available in the open world and over time you have to get better at identifying the few good ones. 

My thoughts on this process - 

1. Choose your Advisor(s) Carefully - Someone who has prior experience (mentors) or someone who knows you best (friends and family).

2. Listen with an open frame of mind - Don't enter the conversation deluded in your own world of what's right and wrong and never seek out advice to confirm if you're doing the right thing.

3. Take it with a pinch of salt - No one knows/cares about you as much as you do.

4. Make Your Own Decision - As it is you who has to live with it and face the consequences.

I really liked Seth Godin's [post](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/05/good-advice.html) on this topic -

Good Advice is ...

Not what you want to hear, but what you need to hear. <br/>
Not imaginary, but practical. <br/>
Not based on fear, but on possibility. <br/> 
Not designed to make you feel better, designed to make you better. <br/> <br/>
