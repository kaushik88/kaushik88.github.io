In his book *Originals*, Adam Grant talks about the 4 choices people have when handling a dissatisfying situation - *exit*, *voice*, *persist* and *neglect*.

**Exit** - Exit means removing yourself from the situation altogether. This could mean quitting your job, ending your marriage or just walking out on a heated argument.

**Voice** - Voice involves actively trying to improve the situation - voicing your concerns and following it up with necessary actions.

**Persist** - Persistence is gritting your teeth and bearing the situation. You've already accepted that the situation sucks but you've decided to go through with it.

**Neglect** - Neglect entails staying in the current situation but reducing your involvement in it. This could mean just doing just enough at work not to get fired.

### Control vs Commitment

The 4 options can be seen as a trade-off between control (Do you believe you can effect change?) and commitment (Do you care enough to try?).

If you feel you can't make a difference, then you would choose to **persist** if you're committed and you'd **neglect** if you aren't.

If you feel you can make a difference, then you would choose to **voice** if you're committed and you'd **quit** if you aren't.
