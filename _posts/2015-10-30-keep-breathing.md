I've been wanting to improve my Badminton skills for a while now and I finally decided to take private coaching. I was really excited about this and had a long list of skills to improve on in the few classes. However, I ended up learning something different!

After watching me play a few rallies, he came to me and said - 

> Kaushik, lots of energy and passion but relax.

I didn't take it too seriously as I was still focused on the drills for the day. About 30 minutes later, after a drill of the *forehand net spin*, he came to me and said -

> Kaushik, don't forget to enjoy and keep breathing!

This wasn't the first time someone had told me this but I was taken aback after hearing this from a person who has just met me for a few minutes. I smiled and before I could nod, he continued - "you don't always have to run too hard to get to the shuttle (birdie) and you don't always have to hit the shuttle as hard as you can to win the point."

At the end, I thanked the coach for a great lesson - he thought I was referring to the badminton skills!
