> A mother is a person who seeing there are only four pieces of pie for five people promptly announces she never did care for pie — Tenneva Jordan.

I can’t think of a better quote to summarize my mother’s character. This Sunday on May 10, I get to spend Mother’s day with her after so many years. While commercialism might be the motive in celebrating days like these, it is not everyday that I get to thank her for all the sacrifices and learnings. This blogpost is dedicated to my mother!

She has sacrificed her dreams for me and has taught me what it means to love unconditionally. She has always believed in me, even when I didn’t. And a few years ago when the finances for my Grad School didn’t work out, she decided to go ‘all in’ and convinced others too (including myself) so that I could study in the University of my choice. And to many more that I couldn’t think of in the last few minutes. Happy Mother’s Day ma!

It doesn’t matter how old you’re or how matured or cool or macho you think you’re — call your mom this Sunday and tell her that you love her. It will make her happy and trust me it will make you too!
