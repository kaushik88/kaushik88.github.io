[Mike Krzyzewski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krzyzewski) is the head coach of the Men's Basketball team at Duke University since the 1980s. This blog post is how his words became an unofficial mantra to Jeff Weiner (CEO of LinkedIn) and his employees.

Everytime the basketball team would complete a shot and run back, CoachK would yell to the team - **Next Play**. It is a phrase that he uses to remind the team to not linger too long on what had just taken place. It is to remind the team that the past has gone and it is time to focus on the present - irrespective of what had happened. It is to remind them not to celebrate too long on the lovely 3-pointer. It is to remind them not to complain or lament about the missed opportunity. It is to remind them what matters most is **now**.

> Take a moment to celebrate your past victories or learn from your past mistakes but don't linger too long on it.

Next Play!
