I was on a hike with my friends and one of them was passionate about brewing coffee and like all passionate people, he was enthusiastically talking about it for a few minutes. At the end of the conversation, another friend said - 

> 'I know nothing about brewing coffee but I like the fact that you're passionate about it.'

I found this quite interesting and got me thinking.

I've been fortunate enough to be surrounded by people who are passionate about a lot of things - blogging, running, skiing, photography, brewing coffee, music, rock climbing, improv, tennis, yoga, talking, hiking, fitness, cooking, chess, cricket, basketball and a lot more. I share some of their passions, some of them have inspired me to pickup their passions, hopefully I've inspired a few too, and to the rest of them - *'I like the fact that you're passionate.'*
