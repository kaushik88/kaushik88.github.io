A little over a month ago, I was having a converstion with a good friend of mine. Everytime, we're presented with an unfavorable or a change in situation, we've two options - react to it in the spur of the moment vs responding after understanding the implications.

**React**

Reacting is the defensive approach - we're under attack and we immediately try to defend ourselves or try to attack back. The upside to this approach is passion - 

**Respond**

Responding is the more thoughtful approach and is guided by logic and not emotion.

This choice presents itself to us all the time, whether itâ€™s our mother nagging us, our co-worker being rude, our husband not being kind enough, and so on. There will always be external events that bother us, but if we learn to respond and not just react, we can make things better and not worse.
