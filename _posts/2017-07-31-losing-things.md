We all lose things and we all have different ways of dealing with it. This blog post is how I deal with it (a little exaggerated for fun) - 

1. Search for it in places that have the least likelihood - I've never opened my travel bag in the last 2 years, but there is a small chance that the glasses I lost yesterday might be in it.

2. Search for it in the same place multiple times - There's a small chance that the item might have crawled back since my last iteration of searching.

3. Ask everyone about it - I'm tired of searching, can you also look for it?

4. Blame it on the next person - Trust me, this feels good :)

5. Buy a better alternative - Losing this object now gives me an opportunity to buy something better.

6. Start saving money so that you can buy it again - If I don't eat out for the next umpteen times, I'll be able to buy it again.

7. Listen to sad music - One of friends did this and it definitely helped him. If you're a Tamil music fan, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS4R7hV-ntM) my recommendation.

8. Watch this [George Carlin Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amVrEaaLApM) - There are some things I don't even care if I get it back but I want to know where it went!

9. Deny that I've lost it - I've not lost it, I just don't remember where I kept it last.
