I was visiting the Sequoia National Park for the Memorial day weekend and after a long hike, we stopped at a sunset point. It was a steep hike to the top but once we reached the top, the views were totally worth it!

The bright red sun was in the west, yellow-red-green color coded trees in the north, snow-capped mountains in the east and a large stream separating 2 mountains in the south. It was really beautiful but I couldn't help but notice the tourists continuously chattering in the background. We wanted to stay longer but the constant chatter ruined the moment. As we just started to walk back, we found a silent corner and decided to spend a few minutes there, no photographs, no conversations, just looking at the view.

When we visit Vista points we're often focused among ourselves - photos and the usual chatter that sometimes I just wish we remain silent, enjoy the mother nature and take it all in!
