**Giving Up**

And those who urge entrepreneurs to never give up? Charlatans. Sometimes you have to give up. Sometimes knowing when to give up, when to try something else, is genius. Giving up doesn’t mean stopping. Don’t ever stop.

**Measuring Yourself**

I keep thinking of one line in The Bucket List. “You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you.”

**Management**

One lesson I took from all my home-schooling about heroes was that they didn’t say much. None was a blabbermouth. None micromanaged. Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.

**Running**

The art of competing, I’d learned from track, was the art of forgetting, and I now reminded myself of that fact. You must forget your limits. You must forget your doubts, your pain, your past. You must forget that internal voice screaming, begging, “Not one more step!” And when it’s not possible to forget it, you must negotiate with it. I thought over all the races in which my mind wanted one thing, and my body wanted another, those laps in which I’d had to tell my body, “Yes, you raise some excellent points, but let’s keep going anyway . . .”

**Competing**

“The cowards never started and the weak died along the way. That leaves us, ladies and gentlemen. Us.” 

**Luck**

Luck plays a big role. Yes, I’d like to publicly acknowledge the power of luck. Athletes get lucky, poets get lucky, businesses get lucky. Hard work is critical, a good team is essential, brains and determination are invaluable, but luck may decide the outcome. Some people might not call it luck. They might call it Tao, or Logos, or Jñāna, or Dharma. Or Spirit. Or God. Put”

“The single easiest way to find out how you feel about someone. Say goodbye.” 

**Business**

“Someone somewhere once said that business is war without bullets, and I tended to agree."

“There were many ways down Mount Fuji, according to my guidebook, but only one way up. Life lesson in that, I thought."

“You are remembered, he said, prophetically, for the rules you break."

“He was easy to talk to, and easy not to talk to—equally important qualities in a friend. Essential in a travel companion."

“For that matter, few ideas are as crazy as my favorite thing, running. It’s hard. It’s painful. It’s risky. The rewards are few and far from guaranteed. When you run around an oval track, or down an empty road, you have no real destination. At least, none that can fully justify the effort. The act itself becomes the destination."
