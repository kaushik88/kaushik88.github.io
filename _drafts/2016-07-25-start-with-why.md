Most companies sell **what** they do (for eg, we sell computers), a few companies see *'how'* they do it (we design our computers beautifully) but very few sell *'why'* they do it. Apple revered the communication and started with why through this commercial -

Another key takeaway from this idea is what motivates teams or partnerships. If everyone in the team has the same line of thought in all the discussions, it is going to be difficult for each of them to learn from one another and grow. For a team to be motivated and constantly learning, they have to agree on a lot of the **Whys** (the values and the purpose) but differ on some of the **Hows** (the process). Jobs and Wozniack, Gates and Paul-Allen, Walt and Disney, Federer and Nadal - they pushed each other so that they can be a better version of themselves.
