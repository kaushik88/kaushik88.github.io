A few days ago, I was watching [The Prestige](www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571) by Christopher Nolan. **Obsession**is one of the central themes of this movie and it got me thinking on the differences between *passion* and *obsession*. This blog post is my thoughts on this topic.

Passion : You want to do it
Obsession : You have to do it.

**Process vs Result**
Passion is more about the process whereas obsession is about the result. 

**Self vs Others**
Passion is focussed on yourself and Obsession is focused on others.
