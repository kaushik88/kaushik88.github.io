Let's be honest - honesty is not easy for most of us. It takes a lot of effort and deliberate practice. You first start at the **Lying is Cool** stage and then proceed your way to **I'm not lying - I'm keeping mum** stage. 

Honest - They give constructive feedback.
Brutally honest - They criticize.

Honest - Focus on others.
Brutally Honest - Self-focussed.
